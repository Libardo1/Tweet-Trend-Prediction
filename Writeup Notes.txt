Writeup Notes

Thought process:

Why did you use the streaming with common words verusus samples? Need to get only english language tweets. Common words covered almost 99% of the tweets. No adverse impacts. Trends are in many tweets, would be caught anyways - unclear if any trends would have coinciding cleavages with the all uncommon word tweets

METHOD 1: Track most common hashtags
	- Return most popular hashtags

	Open questions:
		- Weight by hashtag sequencing (optional add-on)
		- Weight by number of hashtags in a given tweet
		- How many different users are using these hashtags?

	DONE!

METHOD 2: Track most common words
	- Remove the stop words using some kind of stored dictionary
	- Clear out inappropriate words, porn, etc.

	Common words, not trending words, dominate:
		- Stop words (a, the, is, of, etc.), and a HUGE tail. One option is to remove the stop words using a dictionary of them, but this is very difficult, and still gets you common words.
		- Time-based words rise (night, morning, etc.) that aren't really trending

	Note: 46,000 retweets!

	DONE!

METHOD 3: Background model - track frequencies relative to past frequencies
	- Cover at least 1 week to eliminate periodicity problems, track frequencies of words
	- Then, when you get your sample, track against the ratio of past frequency

	Open Questions:
		- What level of tracking should you use? Periodic trends do appear annually, doesn't mean you should wipe them out (ie. don't track yearly periodicity), but you should track monthly periodicity! Find the right middle ground
		- Should you wipe out those with low 'normal' frequency? Ratios will be disproportionatly high, but that doesn't necessarily mean its bad - what about memes (like Jimmy Fallon inventing a new hashtag)?
		- Should also weight higher trend movements more? 20 to 25 vs 20,000 to 25,000
	DONE!

METHOD 4: Authority weighting for trending topics
	- High authority people 'validate' the trending topic by retweeting ie. those with high numbers of followers, etc. 
		- Associate "Most authoritative user" who has tweeted about this's follower count (authoritativeness score) with each word
		- Add some of this weight to the previous "divergence from background" score


METHOD 5: Short Term peaks for finding trends
	- Do repeated pulls from streaming API (ie. for 5 minutes every 1 hour for 6 hours), see differences in term data frequencies
	- Some sort of algorithm to see that link


METHOD 6: Clustering based on TF-IDF/minhash scores of tweets
	- use latent space indexing and cosine similarity to predict hashtags based on Euclidean distance from tweets
	- this would be much more involved because you’re predicting new hashtags that will become trending rather than just using existing hashtags

METHOD 7: predict pre-trending based on current trending hashtags
	- use Euclidean distance to find similarity between hashtags and current trending hashtags
	- hashtags that are more similar to current trending hashtags are weighted more
	- see if current trends affect upcoming trends

	- Wordnet similarity analysis

METHOD 8:  crosscheck hashtags with other tweets for relevance (seems super hard)
	- start with METHOD 1, 2, or 3 (whichever seems most effective?) and then check the hashtags you’ve selected to see if there are some hashtags that weren’t included in certain tweets but are relevant (this is kind of similar to using topics)
    	- e.g., you have one tweet with #government and then later you have a different tweet with #election #president, so #government would fit in here but isn’t here —> this would increase #government’s weight bc the hashtag can be applied to more tweets
    - this would take a lot longer but could be more accurate
    - Wordnet

METHOD 9: Machine Learning for twitter trend prediction (MIT lab)
	Create corpus of tweets
	Pick 200 words that DID trend, pick 200 that DIDN'T
	Use various ML algorithms to train on this dataset
	Give new dataset
	See if it is able to pick out tweets that trend

METHOD 10: Tracking frequencies to specific past times (Real twitter method)
	- Problem of 'morning' used in the evening, not seen as abnormal because usage over the week on average is still high (Even though usage in the evenings is normally low)
	- In response, we could do two things:
		- Track against multiple dimensions - rather than seeing frequency of morning over the past week, see frequency of morning from 8:00-9:00 pm over the past month, or frequency of morning on tuesdays over the past month. Then, we can compare to each of these frequencies, and be more likely to find abnormalities (ie. trending)
		- Create a graph to show trends over time (here's how rush hour's usage changes over time over the past week). Then, we can track how it actually used relative to where the graph predicts to see if it's abnormal

	RUSH HOUR

Things could have improved:

Other options:
	Don't use averages, use a model for time of day/week and track changes
		But, you'd have to build a model for every topic

Prediction
	- Non-unigram terms (Ed Sheeran vs. Ed and Sheeran)
	- Misspelled words
	- Word tenses (using wordNets)
